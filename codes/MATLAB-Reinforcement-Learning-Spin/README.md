# Reinforcement learning example in MATLAB
## Q-Learning Pendulum Swing-Up
Learn a control policy to optimally swing a pendulum from vertical down,
to vertical up with torque limits and (potentially) noise. Both the
pendulum and the policy are animated as the process is going. The
difference from dynamic programming, for instance, is that the policy is
learned only by doing forward simulation. No knowledge of the dynamics is
used to make the policy.
