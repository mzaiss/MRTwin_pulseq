## General recommended settings in Spyder

To have plots as separate window, go to Tools->Preferences. Then on the rider IPythonKonsole go to Graphics and choose for the graphics backend: Automatic. 
Then you have to close and restart spyder.

I recommend to switch the layout to matlab layout. G to View->Layouts -> Matlab Layout or Rstudio Layout.

To be able to go to definitions quickly (CTRL-click), you have to add the included paths ('./codes, ./codes/GradOpt_python, ./codes/scannerloop_libs)  again in your spyder path manually in the menu (Tools/PYTHONPATH):


## Diff tool ##
If you want compare changed files or sample solutions you can use the tools diff, or more visually advanced Kompare or Meld.
