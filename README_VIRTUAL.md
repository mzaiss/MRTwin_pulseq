# MRTwin_pulseq - Readme for virtual attendance

MRTwin is a tool to code sequences manually and simulate MR images using the included Bloch simulation. <br>
All materials and readmes how to install can be found here:<br>
https://github.com/mzaiss/MRTwin_pulseq <br>
The script can be found here: <br>
https://github.com/mzaiss/MRTwin_pulseq/tree/mr0-core/script <br>
I recommend to prepare the script beforehand a bit.

It covers A : basic echoes in 1D, B : gradient echo encoding and fast GRE MRI, C : spin echo and RARE, D : balanced SSFP, E : exporting and scanning at a real MRI system, F : non-cartesian trajectories, undersampling and reconstruction.

For installation at home check [README_HOME.md](README_HOME.md).

## Course setup  - next start at Monday March 20, 2023
The course format is full time two weeks. <br>
We meet  daily from 9:30 am to 5:30 pm (CET).<br>
The first week is very interactive, with small inputs, and interleaved exercises and discussion of them.<br>
The second week is more independent.

Unfortunately, I cannot interact with people joining virtually. But with the script and the available exercises and theirs solutions you should be fine.
For questions regarding installationsI try to dedicate someone in zoom to help you out in a breakout session.
